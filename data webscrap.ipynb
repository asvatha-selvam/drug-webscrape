The first time I had it as I was at the end of the IV I started feeling cold and my blood pressure shot up. The nurses gave me shots to bring it down. The second time I had it, every other week, They gave me some steroids first so I wouldn't have a reaction and I didn't. I did have some achey bones and breakthrough pain. The third time I had it and last time It went fine until I started having 103 degree fevers and my entire body broke out in a red itchy rash. I am on Prednisone IV's and I'm weaning off it right now but the rash is so itchy and nothing takes it away! Too many reactions...\"\n",

The radiation shrank it some but it came roaring back. My Oncologist started me on Opdivo about October of 2018 and it has been smooth sailing so far. Here it is July 31 2019 and I look forward to maybe only one or two more treatments. My last two PET scans have been good. There is no doubt in my mind that I am alive because of this treatment. I have had some shortness of breath, quite a lot of fatigue, a rash or two, some itching.. Nothing unbearable, just uncomfortable. I am grateful for this technology.

It was shortly confirmed that she had large tumors were pretty much everywhere except her brain. Within 3 weeks she died. This treatment in no way worked, indeed her oncologist believes it actually accelerated her melanoma. Please consider not using this treament, it is like playing a game of  roulette!

He developed a fever, became weak, and tired, lost his appetite, experienced severe back pain, and had a cough. He had another treatment at the end of December. At the end of January 2023, we took him to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with pneumonia in his lungs, a kidney infection, a blood clot in his right leg, and a blood clot near his heart in his lung. He also had mild fluid surrounding his heart and gastroparesis. It is February 3rd and he is still in the hospital. The doctors have confirmed through dye and X-rays that gastroparesis is a side effect of Opdivo and not caused by a blockage or mass. They are trying to figure out how to treat him as steroids are not working. Our experience with Opdivo has been thumbs down. If only we had known beforehand.\"\n",

He was diagnosed with Neuroendocrine Carcinoid Tumors in 2010 and survived a wonderful 6 years. He did very well with Afinitor until it began to give him pneumonia. In March this year his doctor started him on Opdivo. HIs energy immediately plummeted. In early March he felt well enough to plan a vacation to Alaska for early June. By early April he wanted to cancel it.  He had 3 injections of Opdivo over March and April. He went into hospice in May and passed away in June.  I'm not saying Opdivo killed him since his cancer markers were starting to rise before starting it, but they skyrocketed after starting it.\"\n",

This was the best medicine he ever took.  Took in combination with Yervoy.  Daddy had CLEAR cell RCC.  It was in his stomach, liver, lung, and right atrium (heart) at the time.  This medicine got rid of the cancer in his stomach, atrium, and lungs.  I highly recommend this medicine.  Daddy was still working at an automotive mechanic while taking this medicine.  Side effects were minimal.  The only thing is his immune system seemed to be more weak.  That was it.  He also had no kidneys left from the cancer.  So he was on dialysis.
